# Emotion Classification with Transformers and Explainable AI (XAI)

This repository contains an end-to-end NLP project for **emotion classification of Bangla text** using **Transformer-based models** such as **Multilingual BERT (mBERT)** and **XLM-RoBERTa**, along with **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques using **SHAP**.

The project was developed as part of **CSE475 – Machine Learning / NLP coursework** and follows a clean, reproducible, and research-style notebook structure.
